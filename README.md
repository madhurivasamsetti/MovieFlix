# Synopis
  This project is used to display a list of movies on the main screen by contacting the server and also displaying the details of 
  individual movie when a user clicks any movie from the list.
  One can toggle with the display list by selecting the options from setting menu.
  User can also save any movie from the list and they can access them by using favorites option from the setting menu.
## Note:
 Inidvidual has to include an API Key to populate these movies.
 The API which i was using in this project is from this website https://www.themoviedb.org
 So one can signup through this and can get API KEY.
